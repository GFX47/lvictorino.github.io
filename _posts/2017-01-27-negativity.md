summary: When you release something it's almost impossible that everybody loves it. It's even more true for games. If you plan to release a game you have to be prepared for some negativity. Coming from you or from the Internets. Here are a few tips.

## The inside enemy

Being positive is good for mental health and for life in general. [It's a well known fact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLJsdqxnZb0). However the production of a game can take time. Staying positive on the long run is very difficult, almost impossible for a lot of people. 

First of all it's always better if you don't dive into this adventure alone. Having a team you can count on will help you to avoid the usual negativity that comes with the loneliness. When you are alone, you are your own boss. You make all the important decisions. And when you're not happy or have doubts about the project there is no one to remind you all the great things you achieved so far. Always share your thoughts when you feel they prevent you of doing a great job. Create a link of truth with your teammates. You will soon realize they can understand and help you feeling lighter. 

The negative one can feel about her own project is almost always related to doubts about the quality, the feasibility, or the message. When you work on something for too long it's very easy to forget the awesome to only see what could have been better. Try to focus on what's essential: the big picture. There is no point in regretting a feature that has not been implemented. Even if the taste is bitter, none of the players will taste it as they won't even know you ever planed to implement this feature you miss so much. They will take the game as you made it, now as you had one day planed to make it. It makes a big different on the perspective. Remember to always see your game as it it, not as what it should have been.

## The outside world

Internet is a great place, but Internet is full of mean people. One of the first rule you should learn in this industry is to not pay too much attention to comments. 

If you take an article about an awesome game you love on a random site, you will always find some hate in the comment section going in the exact opposite direction of what you feel or think. It's something happening on a wide scale on topics way more important than video game development. It's pretty common that the ones who make the most of noise are the meanest ones. Because Internet anonymity offers a fake feeling of security they say all the dumb things they have one their mind. Sometimes they do it without thinking that some fellow human beings could be hurt on the way.

Video game development is still seen as a mystical and magical activity where only some elite can live. A lot of people don't see the development of video game as an easy activity one can do alone or with a very small team. When they think only huge companies with no human faces can produce games it makes it very easy to insult everything about the games and people who make them.[^1]

You can't avoid or prevent hate about what you do. Video game is (still) a creative activity and people may not share your taste. It's normal. What is not is to only take the bad and mean critics about your game and give them too much credit. Your game won't please every one. It's simply not possible. For you and your game sake you must only take what is relevant in the comment and critics.[^2] 

Use only what you feel could make your game better. But don't use everything. Remember that you make a game for a lot of various people to play, not only the loudest ones. You are not born game designer, neither they are. You know your game better than anyone, you know where it will go, and what it should look like when the release date comes. Don't let others decide for your what should or should not be in your game. Take what you feel can make it a better thing, and let the rest on the Internet. 

Even if it's hard, try to always be constructive with people's feedback. Try to understand if the point is justified or not and act accordingly. But, please, don't spend too much time reading thoughts and points about your game. It may lead you to even stop making your game. We all know game designers and game developers who had very harsh times dealing with critics. Use it for the better, but conscientiously.

If you really want to have a recurrent feed of information and feedback about your game, start a forum on your web site. In contrary to the articles and news comments, people registering to a game forum usually come to make it better, not just spit on it or it's creators. Use a forum to gather players and talk about the game. However, you should also take care to avoid the over positive feedback. They are almost as dangerous for your sake as the negative ones.


## Create a virtuous circle

To keep the pace with your game it's important to create a virtuous circle. Talking about positive things, or quoting positive feedback will, naturally, create more positive things and feedback. Use it for you, your mental health, your communication, your audience... everything. It's easy to become enthusiast for something when you realize most of the people are already very positive about it. The only important thing to keep in mind here is to be sure to not let people have fancy expectation about the game. You should always communicate about the positive truth but to let your future players imagine a game that is very different of the one you're working on. [Recent industry drama](https://gamerant.com/no-mans-sky-death-threats-752/) proved that when players have a biased idea of what a game will be it can end dramatically for the team. Always be positive but honest about your game.

## In the end

Making a game is difficult enough to not dive into an infinite hole of negativity. Always remember your game strengths, fit to your initial plan and use the positivity of your future players to release the best game possible.

[^1]: it's not something I encourage you to do but I sometimes enjoy answering very nicely in the comment section when someone is virulent about a game I did. Usually people's tone change to become nicer and calmer. But, again, don't do this. It's stupid, you won't ever change someone who is dumb enough to don't understand that games are made by people.
[^2]: and it goes both ways. You should not be over confident because you only had great feedback or critics on what you're doing. Keep only what is relevant.
