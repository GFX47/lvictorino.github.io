summary: Making a game is a long and difficult activity. It is then very important to well prepare the work even before starting. Knowing how to use the five major milestones of game development helps to keep track of the progress and always be prepared for what comes next.

A video game in development is a living entity. Every time one of the team member takes a shower and has a blast, a new idea appears. If this idea is good enough and added to the todo list the game direction will vary a little bit. After a year or more of development if there is no way to control the game direction, the sum of every tiny variation might just have changed the whole face of the initial game concept putting a lot of distance between the game idea and the actual game. Worse, the team can even end lost and traped into the infamous limbo of eternal game development with no hope of ever ending the game production.

To avoid this kind of tricky situation it's considered healthier to divide the development into milestones. The duration between two milestones can vary from a very small amount (~a week) to a larger one (2 months +). Among all these milestone it's better to define important ones acting like pillars for the production. The kind of points that can light the way even throught fog. 

There are five major milestones that should be used and found in your game developments to help you keep head above water.

## Prototype
[You should know prototypes very well by now](/blog/what-is-a-prototype). This first and early step of development is essential, it comes right before the actual production begins and is here to test your core concept and idea. With a good prototype you should be well aware of dangers on your way to succes and ready to tackle them. Its the first milestone but also the only one where you can stop everything. If the results to the tests done during the prototyping phase are good you know you can try to make a good game out of them. However it's important to stop everything and kill or re-think the idea if the prototype shows some flaws or problems. If you are still in doubts when the prototype is supposed to be finished, don't go to the next milestone and re-think the core concept of your game. More important, don't give you more time to add features to your prototype, you would end adding crap on top of crappy foundations.

One month or two spent on the prototype should be enough to know where your game is going.

## First playable
Once the prototype is good and validated, the next logical step is called the First Playable. It's obviously the first playable version of the game. Not really an alpha yet, because not complete enough, but not a prototype, because cleaner and more complete, the first playable version aims to show the real guts of the game more than the sole concept. The first playable is almost never a complete flow of the game: the main menu is often missing, there is no real player ranking or real story… but the main elements are here and playable. 

Also one of the most visible difference between the first playable and the prototype is about art. While it's normal to use placeholder and ugly assets in the prototype, everything should be replaced by not final but prettier assets in the first playable.

At the end of this milestone you should have something showable to potential investors without having to warn them about the distastrous bugs and temporary arts.

From 3 months to 6 months or more, the duration of this milestone will vary greatly from a game concept to another.

## Vertical slice

Once you have enough to show the guts of your game, it's time to work on more content. Here comes the Vertical Slice. 

It's like a slice of cake. Not the whole cake, but just enough to have a full taste of it… with every layers of chocolate and sweet things. 

It's the same thing with the game. Of course it won't be the complete game with all features. But enough features to show and let the player understand what the final game will be. In a car game, for example, you won't have every cars available, but they will be visible in the selection menu (sometimes with locks to explain that they will come later). The same  would go with the race tracks. Even if all the content is not here, the main gameplay will be available, thanks to the prototype and the first playable, and the place holders and extra features makes the vertical slice look like a real and almost complete game. 

At the end of this milestone (going from 3 to 6 months or more) you should have something ready for alpha test or early access.
