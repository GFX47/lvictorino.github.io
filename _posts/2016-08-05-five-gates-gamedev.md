summary: Making a game is a long and difficult activity. It is then very important to well prepare the work even before starting. Knowing how to use the five major milestones of game development helps to keep track of the progress and always be prepared for what comes next.

A video game in development is a living entity. Every time one of the team member takes a shower and has a blast, a new idea appears and, if this idea is good enough and added to the todo list, the game direction will vary a little bit. After a year or more of development if there is no way to control the game direction, every tiny variation might just change the whole face of the core concept, with a final build very different from the original idea… Worst, the team can even end lost and traped into the infamous limbo of eternal game development.

To avoid this kind of tricky situation it's considered healthier to divide the development into milestones. The duration between two milestones can vary from a very small amount (~a week) to a larger one (2 months +). Among all these milestone it's better to define important ones. The kind of points in time that can follow the game marketing strategy. 

Usualy five major milestones are always present during the game development lifetime.

## Prototype
[You should know prototypes very well by now](/blog/what-is-a-prototype). This first and early step of development is essential.
It comes right before the actual production begins and is here to test your core concept and idea. With a good prototype you should be well aware of danger on your way to succes and ready to tackle it. Its the first milestone but also the only one where you can stop everything. If the results to the tests done during the prototyping phase are good you know you can try to make a good game out of them. However it's important to stop everything and kill or re-think the idea if the prototype shows some flaws or problem. If you are still in doubts when the prototype is supposed to be finished, don't go to the next milestone and re-think the core concept of your game. 

## First playable
Once the prototype is good and validated, the next logical step is called First Playable. It's obviously the first playable version of the game. Not really an alpha yet, because not complete enough, but not a prototype, because cleaner and more complete, the first playable version aims to show the guts of the game. It's almost never a complete flow, the main menu is often missing, there is no real ranking or real story… but the main elements are here and playable. 

Also one of the most visible difference between the first playable and the prototype is about art. While it's normal to use placeholder and ugly assets in the prototype, everything should be replaced by not final, but prettier, assets in the first playable.

At the end of this milestone you should have something showable to potential investors without having to warn them about the distastrous bugs and temporary arts.
