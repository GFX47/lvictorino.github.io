Hey there. Welcome back.

I'm currently redefining the editorial line of this blog. In fact I realized that more and more people are contacting me to have advice before starting an indie trip. Helping others, if possible, is way more exciting than just talking about my life. That's why everything has been freshen up.

That said, I'll try to post more content, more often. So you can consider this post as my new year resolution... of the end of September.

As you can see the visual look has changed as well as the URL. Don't forget to update your bookmarks and RSS readers to match [lvictorino.com][1]

For those who liked it, and for the curious one wondering what it was, don't worry the content of my previous blog is still available [here][2].
