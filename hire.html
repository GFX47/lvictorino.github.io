<div class="py2">
  
  <p>As I'm a curious programmer I always love to work with new people on new projects. Sometimes I'm even ok to do freelance missions when I can help a cool project to rise.</p>

  <p>If you have an awesome project on what you need a programmer, I might be able to help. I'm an experienced (almost 10 years) video game programmer. Specialized in UI and Gameplay programming I have worked on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/games/">very small and gigantic AAA games</a>. Even if I have done a lot of C/C++ development I am now expert in Unity3D, and I often give classes and conference about this engine. I have even taught Game Design during a year and a half.</p>
  
  <p>If you feel like I could help you, feel free to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/contact/">contact me</a>.</p>
