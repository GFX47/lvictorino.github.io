  <p>Hi! My name is Laurent Victorino, and this is my personnal blog.</p>

  <p>Natural born curious, gamer, and dreamer, I always loved to smash my keyboard randomely waiting for cool things to happen. Even if I made a lot of different stuff back then, I decided very early that my professional life would be full of video games. I worked several years on AAA console games for big publishers and now I'm making my way as an independant with my own company <a href="http://www.monkeymoon.net">Monkey Moon</a>.</p>

  <p>Even if I'm fluent in C, C++ and C#, I like to write scripts in various langages, such as Python, Ruby, PHP or LUA. Now expert in Unity3D I gave several conferences and classes about this engine for big companies like Nokia or Microsoft. As I try to be a bit more than a code monkey I love talking about video game development in places people don't expect to see it. With that in mind, I taught Game Design to a 20 art student class during a year and a half, and I often teach what's behind video games to group of teenagers in several museums. Because I love helping others I even sometimes do <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/hire">freelance missions</a>.</p>

  <p>Since I started Monkey Moon I met a lot of people in need of advice, help or details about what it is to be an independant game developer. This blog is here to help. I will share what I learnt along the way about various aspects of the indie game dev life. I sincerely hope my experience will help someone.</p>
